# OVARP Server — Feature Reference

What the platform does, how to use each piece, and where it lives in the code.

OVARP runs HCI studies with an embodied conversational agent. You define the agent's persona,
let a participant talk to it on their own device, steer it live if you need to, and take away a
timestamped record of everything that happened.

## The console

The Wizard-of-Oz console at `http://localhost:8000` is organised as the steps of a study, in order.

| Tab | What it is for |
|---|---|
| **(01) Overview** | Where to start, and whether the server is healthy. Opens here by default. |
| **(02) LLM Playground** | Build and try the agent. |
| **(03) Profiles** | Author and apply personas. |
| **(04) Study Session** | Run a participant through the protocol. |
| **(05) WoZ Control** | Intervene mid-session; also holds the client connection details. |
| **(06) Surveys** | Send questionnaires and watch scores arrive. |
| **(07) API Key Store** | Set provider credentials without editing `.env`. |
| **(08) System Logs** | Server stdout and browser errors. |

A dismissible **Getting Started** banner explains the platform and walks through those steps.
It stays dismissed via `localStorage`. A **theme toggle** in the header switches the console
between dark and light, remembered per browser.

### Overview

The landing tab, because opening straight onto a control surface left people with no idea what
the platform was for. It carries a **Quick-Start launcher** per stage of a study, in order, plus
live status — server connection, active session, active LLM provider, API key storage, connected
clients, applied persona — and the two CSV exports.

### Playground

Everything needed to shape the agent, in one column:

- **Pipeline status** — which provider, model and voice are actually answering, stated once
  instead of inferred from three separate pickers, with a standing STT / LLM / TTS / Total
  latency readout underneath.
- **Agent Persona** — apply a profile to the target agent, or create one with **New** without
  leaving the tab. Selecting the empty option releases the agent back to the global prompt.
- **System Prompt** — the global prompt, used by agents that have no profile.
- **LLM / TTS provider and voice** — chosen independently of one another.
- **Custom endpoint registration** — see [AI providers](#ai-providers).
- **Simulated conversation** — type or hold the mic to talk. STT runs either in the browser
  (WebSpeech, no API key) or server-side.
- **Stop Audio** — cut the agent off mid-sentence and drop its queued speech.
- **3D avatar** — lip-synced VRM preview.

> **Why the prompt box can warn you**
> Applying a profile parks a composed prompt on that agent, and it wins over the global one.
> Editing the global prompt then does nothing for that agent. The console says so explicitly:
> a warning above the prompt box names the agents currently following a profile.

### Live Control

Fire `execute_state` commands at connected clients in real time — emotions, gestures, gaze,
movement, avatar. The buttons are generated from `config.yaml → custom_commands`, so the
vocabulary is whatever your experiment declares.

Also holds **Direct TTS**, which makes the agent speak an exact line without involving the LLM,
and the **XR Connection** card described under [Connecting clients](#connecting-clients).

---

## Agent personas

A persona ("profile") bundles identity, voice, personality and guardrails into a preset you can
apply in one click — the unit of an experimental condition.

Profiles live in `profiles/*.yaml` and are composed into a system prompt by
`build_system_prompt()` in [`src/core/profile_manager.py`](src/core/profile_manager.py).

### Authoring from the console

The **New** button in the Profiles tab, and the one next to the persona picker in the Playground,
open the same editor. Both are places you realise the persona needs a change, so there is one
dialog rather than two.

Fields: id, display name, system prompt, voice provider and voice, avatar, role, gender, age,
backstory, guardrail rules, and a max response length.

**Profiles created in the console are written to `profiles/<id>.yaml`**, so they survive a restart.
Editing rewrites that file; deleting removes it.

### Applying

Apply to one agent or to all of them. Applying sets the agent's prompt and pins its voice, and
sends an `execute_state` avatar command to connected clients if the profile specifies one.

`POST /api/agents/{id}/reset` releases an agent back to the global prompt and voice — the way back
out, so the console's settings become the single source of truth again.

### Legacy conditions

The `conditions:` block in `config.yaml` still works. Each entry is migrated to a
`condition_<id>` profile at boot, and `/api/conditions/*` remains as a thin shim. Scenario steps
that name a `condition` resolve through the same profile system, so a scenario and the Profiles
tab take one code path.

---

## Sessions and event markers

Start a session with a participant ID, then pause, resume and end it. The timer excludes paused
time. Session state is exposed at `GET /api/session/status` and drives the console live.

### Markers

Timestamped annotations of what happened. Fire them three ways:

1. **Preset buttons** — defined in `config.yaml → event_markers`, with labels and colours.
   **Add Preset** invents one mid-study; it lasts until the server restarts, because a preset
   thought up during a session is a convenience for that session, not an edit to the experiment.
2. **Free-text box** — type a label and hit Enter.
3. **Programmatically** — any connected device or agent can send
   `{command_type: "system", command: "log_marker", subcommand: {label, metadata}}` over the bus.

### Reclassifying a marker

Markers can be corrected after the fact — the edit button on any row in the history opens an
inline editor for the **category**, the label and a free-text notes field, and the delete button
removes one fired by mistake. Categories are the usual review vocabulary: Technical Issue,
Participant Confused, User Interrupted, Task Completed, Researcher Note.

**The timestamp is never touched, and nothing is rewritten.** The session log is append-only: the
original `marker` entry stays as captured and the correction is appended as `marker_amended`,
carrying both the previous and the new value. An edited marker is flagged in the console, and the
CSV export carries `marker_amended_from` / `marker_amended_to` columns. `GET /api/session/export/csv`
gives the shorter, marker-only table, with the category in the `Category_or_Label` column.

That property is deliberate — a study record has to keep showing what was captured live, not just
its latest state. Preserve it when adding anything else that lets a researcher change recorded data.

---

## Questionnaires

Send validated instruments to the participant's own phone and collect scored responses next to
the interaction log.

### Shipped instruments

| File | Instrument | Scoring |
|---|---|---|
| `surveys/sus.yaml` | System Usability Scale, 10 items | 0–100 |
| `surveys/ueq.yaml` | User Experience Questionnaire, 26 bipolar items | six scales on −3…+3 |
| `surveys/qualitative.yaml` | Five open questions | none |

All three carry English and Spanish text; the participant page takes `?lang=es`.
SUS and UEQ include their attribution, which UEQ requires.

### How it works

The **Surveys** tab builds a link, fills in the participant ID from the active session, and
either copies it or opens it in a new window. The participant opens
`/survey.html?id=sus&lang=es&participant=P001` on their phone — a standalone, mobile-first page
with a progress bar, per-question validation and a confirmation screen. It needs no console
access and no token.

Submitted responses are scored server-side, appended to the session JSONL, and appear in the
console's results panel with SUS bands and per-scale UEQ values.

### Adding your own

Drop a YAML file in `surveys/` and restart. Same pattern as `scenarios/` and `profiles/`.

```yaml
id: my_questionnaire
name: "Post-task questions"
kind: likert          # likert | bipolar | open
scoring: none         # sus | ueq | none
scale: {min: 1, max: 7, min_label: "Never", max_label: "Always"}
items:
  - id: q1
    text: "The agent understood me"
    text_es: "El agente me entendió"
```

Bipolar items use `left`/`right` instead of `text`, plus a `scale:` name and `reverse:` when the
positive pole sits on the left. Scoring lives in
[`src/core/survey_manager.py`](src/core/survey_manager.py) and is verified against each
instrument's published reference values.

---

## Scripted scenarios

YAML protocols in `scenarios/` that walk a researcher through a study step by step. Each step
carries an instruction and can automatically fire a marker, apply a persona, and dispatch an
action to the clients.

The console shows progress, the current instruction, and Next / Stop controls.

---

## AI providers

Built in: **OpenAI** (STT, LLM, TTS) and **Gemini** (LLM, TTS). LLM and TTS providers are selected
independently, so you can run a local LLM with OpenAI voices.

Anything OpenAI-compatible — Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM — needs no code. Register it from the
Playground with a base URL, model and optional key; test connectivity before committing. The
registry persists to `custom_providers.yaml`.

A health strip shows each provider's key status, with the active one marked.

Writing a genuinely new provider means implementing
`BaseLLMProvider.generate_response_with_actions` in [`src/providers/base.py`](src/providers/base.py),
returning `(spoken_reply, actions_dict)`.

---

## Connecting clients

The **XR Connection** card in Live Control reports the address to use, and which one depends on
how the client is served.

A browser page served over HTTPS cannot open a `ws://` socket — the browser blocks it before any
handshake. `localhost` used to be documented as an exception; **it is not, as of Chrome 151
(2026), verified live against the published web client**: `ws://localhost:8000` from an
`https:` page hangs until timeout, with no "Mixed Content" warning, so it looks like a bug
rather than a browser policy. So:

| Client | Address |
|---|---|
| Native XR build on the same Wi-Fi | `ws://<LAN IP>:8000` |
| Hosted web client (e.g. the published Vercel build), any server location, current Chrome | `wss://…` (needs a tunnel or TLS, even on the same machine) |

`GET /api/server/info` returns `lan_ws_url` and `public_ws_url` separately, deriving the scheme
from `X-Forwarded-Proto`. Behind a tunnel it reports `wss://`, and the card tells you which
address applies to which client instead of advertising one that will not connect.

To reach a phone or another machine:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8000
```

Then enter the printed URL **with `wss://`** in the client — not the `https://` form it prints.

`client_url` in `config.yaml` is the single source for where the published client lives. It is
set to the Vercel deployment, and three places in the console open it in a new tab: **WEB CLIENT**
in the header, **Open Web Client** on the Overview tab, and the button on this card. Comment the
setting out and all three disappear.

That client is separate from the built-in `/player`: `/player` is served by this server and speaks
the bus directly, while the Vercel one is the Unity WebGL build and needs a `wss://` address to
reach you.

---

## Security

Both settings are opt-in and absent by default, so a localhost run needs no setup. Set both before
exposing the server through a tunnel or a deployment.

### `OVARP_ACCESS_TOKEN`

Every `/api/` call must carry it in an `X-OVARP-Token` header. The console asks once and keeps it
in `sessionStorage`; [`src/static/js/api.js`](src/static/js/api.js) wraps `window.fetch` so every
call is covered without each call site being rewritten.

Two things are deliberately exempt: the agent WebSocket (`/ws/client/{id}`), because XR clients
authenticate by being a device declared in `config.yaml`, and the participant survey page,
because a participant has no token.

### `OVARP_SECRET_KEY`

Encrypts stored credentials at rest with Fernet, the key derived from the passphrase: custom
providers in `custom_providers.yaml` and the built-in provider keys in `provider_keys.yaml`.
Without it both still work in plain text, so upgrading breaks nothing.

Independently of encryption, **a credential never rides along on a response that something
polls**. `GET /api/providers` reports `has_key: true|false`; `GET /api/keys/status` reports a
mask and a storage badge. The raw value comes back only from `POST /api/keys/reveal`, which the
console calls when a researcher presses **Show**.

### The API Key Store

The console's key tab writes through the same path. **Apply for this run** sets the key in the
server process and rebuilds the provider SDK clients, so the very next call authenticates with
it — no restart. **Save to the key store** additionally writes it to `provider_keys.yaml`, which
is git-ignored and restored on boot. A saved key wins over `.env`: it is what the researcher set
last, and they expect it to stick.

---

## Telemetry and export

Every command through the bus, every marker, every latency measurement and every questionnaire
response is written to `data/sessions/session_<timestamp>.jsonl`, tagged with the participant and
session ID when one is active.

`GET /api/export` flattens it to CSV for SPSS/R:

```
iso_time, host_timestamp, event_type, participant_id, experiment_session_id,
sender, target_device, target_agent, command_type, command, subcommand_json,
marker_label, marker_metadata, marker_id, marker_amended_from, marker_amended_to,
survey_id, survey_score, survey_answers
```

Per-interaction latency is broken down into STT, LLM, TTS and total milliseconds.

XR clients can also batch head/hand/gaze frames to `POST /api/xr/telemetry`.

---

## Architecture

A message bus, not a request/response API. Everything on the wire is a `BaseCommand`, validated
against `config.yaml` at runtime.

```
Transports (ZMQ 5555/5556, WS /ws/client/{id})
    ↓ raw JSON
CommandRouter          — validate → telemetry → dispatch
    ↓ intercepts by (command_type, command)
DialogOrchestrator     — STT → LLM → TTS, per-agent state
    ↓ providers/
back through Router → all transports
```

### Where things live

| Path | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `src/main.py` | Bootstrap only — build, wire, mount |
| `src/core/runtime.py` | Composition root; routers read collaborators from here |
| `src/api/routers/` | One module per API area |
| `src/api/deps.py` | Console access token |
| `src/api/websockets.py` | `/ws/client/{id}` and `/ws/logs` |
| `src/core/schemas.py` | `BaseCommand`, the single wire format |
| `src/core/orchestrator.py` | The STT → LLM → TTS pipeline and per-agent state |
| `src/core/profile_manager.py` | Personas |
| `src/core/survey_manager.py` | Questionnaires and scoring |
| `src/core/secrets.py` | Credential encryption and redaction |
| `src/core/telemetry.py` | JSONL logging and CSV export |
| `src/static/index.html` | Console shell |
| `src/static/js/*.js` | Console behaviour, one module per area |
| `src/static/survey.html` | Participant-facing questionnaire page |

### Single sources of truth

Three settings used to be reachable two ways, with one silently winning. Each now has one
resolution point:

- **Prompt** — an agent's own prompt wins over the global one. `/api/llm/config` reports
  `agents_overriding_global` so the console can say so, and `/api/agents/{id}/reset` is the way back.
- **Voice** — `DialogOrchestrator._resolve_tts(agent_id)` decides. A profile pins a voice; anything
  unpinned follows the console's picker.
- **Conditions** — the scenario runner resolves a step's `condition` through the profile system.

## Testing

```bash
OVARP_TESTING=1 OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-dummy GEMINI_API_KEY=dummy python -m pytest -q
```

280 tests. `OVARP_TESTING=1` skips transport and provider bootstrap and serves a bare app; tests
substitute collaborators on the runtime container
(`monkeypatch.setattr(runtime, "orchestrator", mock)`).

Areas with the heaviest coverage: personas including persistence round-trips (27), sessions and
markers (34), survey scoring against each instrument's published reference values (15), and access
control and credential handling (13).
