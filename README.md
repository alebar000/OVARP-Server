## ✨ What is OVARP?

The **Open Virtual Agent Research Platform (OVARP)** is a provider-agnostic server that sits between AI services (such as OpenAI, Google Gemini, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint) and client applications (such as web apps, mobile clients, or XR engines like Unity and Unreal) to orchestrate the behavior of embodied virtual agents. It provides:

- 🧠 **Multi-provider LLM** — Hot-swap between any supported LLM (e.g., OpenAI, Gemini, Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM) mid-conversation
- 🔊 **Multi-provider TTS** — Auto-matched to active LLM (e.g., OpenAI voices, Gemini voices)
- 🔌 **Custom Endpoints** — Register any OpenAI-compatible API from the UI — no code changes needed
- 🎙️ **STT** — Speech-to-text transcription from client microphone audio
- 🎤 **Voice Selection** — Pick from 22 TTS voices with gender badges (♂️/♀️/⚧️), switchable at runtime
- 👤 **Agent Profiles** — Rich persona definitions (identity, voice, personality, guardrails, backstory) in YAML, applied per-agent
- 🧑 **3D Avatar** — Lip-synced, emotion-reactive embodied agent via `@OVARP/web-client`
- 🎮 **Wizard-of-Oz Console** — Full web dashboard for researchers to monitor and control experiments
- 📡 **Dual Transport** — WebSocket (for web and mobile clients) + ZeroMQ (for low-latency XR engines), extensible to other protocols
- 📊 **Telemetry & Logging** — Structured JSONL event capture with CSV export
- 🧪 **Session Management** — Start/pause/resume/end experiment sessions with participant tracking
- 📌 **Event Markers** — Timestamped researcher annotations during sessions
- ⏱️ **Latency Metrics** — Real-time pipeline timing (STT, LLM, TTS) per interaction
- 📋 **Scripted Scenarios** — YAML-defined experiment protocols with step-by-step execution
- 🥽 **XR Telemetry Ingest** — Batch head/hand/gaze tracking data from XR clients
- 🗂️ **Per-Agent State** — Each agent maintains its own conversation history, prompt, and voice

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- An API key for at least one provider:
  - [OpenAI API Key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) — for LLM + TTS + STT
  - [Google Gemini API Key](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) — for LLM + TTS

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/AURAxLab/OpenVirtualAgentResearchPlatform-Server.git
cd OpenVirtualAgentResearchPlatform-Server

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
# Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -r requirements_dev.txt   # Only needed to run the test suite
pip install google-genai              # For Gemini provider

# Configure API keys
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and fill in your API keys
```

> **Python 3.10+ is required**, not merely recommended: `str | Path` annotations
> are evaluated at import time and 3.9 fails to start the server.

> If you move or rename the project directory after creating the venv, the
> scripts in `venv/bin/` keep pointing at the old absolute path and fail with
> `bad interpreter`. Either recreate the venv, or call the tools through the
> interpreter — `./venv/bin/python -m pip`, `./venv/bin/python -m pytest` —
> which does not rely on the shebang.

### Run the Server

To run the server with the graphical Wizard of Oz interface and LLM playground:
```bash
uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

### Headless Monitoring Mode
If you are running the server in production or on a machine where the 3D GUI is unnecessary, you can start it in headless mode. This serves a lightweight, high-performance monitoring dashboard instead:

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
$env:OVARP_HEADLESS="true"; uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

**Linux / macOS:**
```bash
OVARP_HEADLESS=true uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

---

## 🌐 Connect to the Published Web Client

The reference web client (`../OVARP-UnityWebClient`, Unity 6 WebGL) is published on Vercel at
**https://ovarp-unity-web-client.vercel.app/**. Its "OVARP server" field is what you point at
your local server.

**Pointing it at `ws://localhost:8000` or `ws://127.0.0.1:8000` does not work.** A page served
over `https:` (the Vercel deployment) cannot open a plain `ws://` socket to `localhost` on a
current Chrome (verified live on Chrome 151, 2026): the connection never reaches the server
(zero lines in the uvicorn log) and the client hangs until it times out with
`Timed out connecting to ws://localhost:8000/ws/client/web_01.` No "Mixed Content" warning is
shown, which is why this looks like a bug rather than a browser policy. Older docs describing
`ws://localhost:8000` as always safe for a same-machine hosted client are stale for this reason.

The path that actually works end to end is a `wss://` tunnel:

```bash
# 1. Fill in a real API key in .env (OPENAI_API_KEY or GEMINI_API_KEY):
#    a placeholder key gets you a valid connection but an "API key not valid" reply.
uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

# 2. In a second terminal, open an ephemeral tunnel (no account needed):
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8000
```

`cloudflared` prints an `https://<random>.trycloudflare.com` URL. Take that hostname, swap the
scheme to `wss://`, and paste `wss://<random>.trycloudflare.com/ws/client/web_01` into the "OVARP
server" field on the published client. This has been verified end to end: WebSocket connects,
`llm_request` reaches the orchestrator, the configured LLM provider replies, TTS audio streams
back as `tts_chunk`/`tts_complete`, and an avatar `execute_state` action fires: full pipeline,
not just transport.

When you're done, stop both `cloudflared` and `uvicorn`; the tunnel URL is public while it runs.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture & Scaling

1.  **Transport Layer**: `ZMQTransport` and `WebSocketTransport` handle raw JSON bytes asynchronously. Both support **Unicast Targeted Routing**, allowing multiple XR headsets to connect to the same server simultaneously without crossing audio or action streams.
2.  **Command Router**: Parses incoming standard `BaseCommand` JSON schemas, validates against `config.yaml`, and logs them.
3.  **Dialog Orchestrator**: Manages AI conversations, injecting history and triggering the correct providers.

> **Running Multiple Quest 3s?** 
> Check out the [Scaling Section in the Unity Integration Guide](UNITY_INTEGRATION.md#3-scaling-multiple-headsets--multiple-servers) for details on how to add devices to `config.yaml` and load balance across multiple Server IPs.

## 📱 Integration Guides

Detailed step-by-step guides for connecting client applications to OVARP:

| Platform | Guide | Covers |
|----------|-------|--------|
| **Unity** | [UNITY_INTEGRATION.md](UNITY_INTEGRATION.md) | WebSocket/ZMQ, audio workflows, XR telemetry, sessions, profiles |
| **Unreal Engine 5** | [UNREAL_INTEGRATION.md](UNREAL_INTEGRATION.md) | Full C++ WebSocket client, TTS playback, XR telemetry, sessions, profiles |
| **Mobile (React Native / Flutter)** | [MOBILE_INTEGRATION.md](MOBILE_INTEGRATION.md) | WebSocket, VRM rendering, sessions, profiles |

> **Tip:** All guides share the same `BaseCommand` JSON schema and REST API. The main difference is the transport layer and language-specific code examples.

## 🎮 WoZ Console Features

The built-in web console provides a full research interface across eight tabs,
numbered in the order a study actually runs:

`(01) OVERVIEW` · `(02) LLM PLAYGROUND` · `(03) PROFILES` · `(04) STUDY SESSION` ·
`(05) WOZ CONTROL` · `(06) SURVEYS` · `(07) API KEY STORE` · `(08) SYSTEM LOGS`

### 🧭 Overview
The landing tab, so a first run opens on something that explains itself:
- **Quick-Start launchers** — one button per stage of a study, in order
- **Live system status** — server connection, active session, active LLM provider,
  API key storage state, connected clients, applied persona
- **Telemetry export** — markers CSV and full telemetry CSV
- **Open Player** — launch the participant client without hunting for the URL

A **theme toggle** in the header switches the whole console between dark and light.

### 🎮 WoZ Control
- **Target selection** — Choose device and agent from config dropdowns
- **Dynamic action buttons** — Auto-generated from `config.yaml` command categories
- **Direct TTS** — Type text → agent speaks it, bypassing LLM
- **Telemetry log** — Real-time event stream with CSV export

### 💬 LLM Playground
Interactive chat interface for testing the AI pipeline:
- **Hot-swap LLM providers** — Switch between OpenAI, Gemini, and custom endpoints mid-conversation
- **Register custom endpoints** — Add Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, or any OpenAI-compatible endpoint from the UI
- **System prompt editor** — Customize the agent's personality in real time
- **TTS toggle** — Enable/disable voice synthesis
- **Voice picker** — Choose from 22 TTS voices with gender icons (♂️/♀️/⚧️)
- **Auto-matched TTS** — When using Gemini LLM → Gemini TTS voice; when using OpenAI → OpenAI voice
- **Pipeline status card** — which provider, model and voice are actually answering,
  restated in one place instead of inferred from three separate pickers
- **Latency readout** — a standing STT / LLM / TTS / Total panel, plus per-reply timing
  on each message
- **Stop Audio** — cut the agent off mid-sentence and drop its queued speech
- **Agent Persona picker** — apply a profile, or create one with **New**, without leaving the tab
- **Persistent state** — Chat history, config, and avatar selection survive page reloads

### 🧪 Study Session
Dedicated experiment management tab:
- **Session lifecycle** — Start/pause/resume/end with participant ID tracking
- **Live timer** — Tracks active session duration (correctly pauses)
- **Event markers** — Timestamped annotations with history display
- **Reclassification** — edit a marker's category, label or notes after the fact. The
  timestamp is never touched and the change is appended to the session log, so the
  record still shows what was captured live
- **Marker preset builder** — invent a preset mid-study (held in memory for that run)
- **Session summary** — Live display of session ID, elapsed time, marker count
- **Scenario runner** — Load YAML protocol scripts with progress bar, auto-applied conditions/markers/actions
- **Scenario builder** — compose a protocol step by step and save it to `scenarios/<id>.yaml`

### 👤 Agent Profiles
Dedicated profile management tab:
- **Profile library** — Browse all available profiles with name, role, gender icon, and voice
- **Profile detail view** — Full identity, personality traits (empathy/formality/self-disclosure), guardrails, voice config, and backstory
- **Apply to agents** — Select target agent (or "All") and apply a profile with one click
- **Runtime creation** — Create new profiles via API from XR devices or the console
- **Conditions migration** — Legacy `conditions:` entries are auto-migrated to profiles on startup

### 🧑 Embodied Agent
A 3D avatar rendered with **Three.js + three-vrm** that:
- 👄 **Lip-syncs** with TTS audio via Web Audio API `AnalyserNode`
- 😊 **Displays emotions** from LLM action calls (happy, sad, angry, surprised)
- 👀 **Blinks** naturally at random intervals
- 🫁 **Breathes** with subtle spine movement
- 🔄 **Sways** gently for lifelike idle behavior
- 📂 **Upload custom VRM models** — Drag-and-drop avatar replacement

**No avatar model ships with this repository** — none is licensed for
redistribution. Drop `.vrm` or `.glb` files into `src/static/models/` and they
appear in the console picker, served from `/models/<filename>`; `GET /api/avatars`
is what the picker reads. With the directory empty the console offers the Upload
button instead of loading a default, which is what it used to do against a file
that was never committed.

### 📋 Surveys
Questionnaires the participant answers on their own device — SUS, UEQ-S and free-text
prompts, defined in `surveys/*.yaml`. The console hands you a link to send to their
phone and shows computed scores as responses come in.

### 🔑 API Key Store
Provider credentials without editing `.env` and restarting:
- **Apply for this run** — the key takes effect immediately; the provider clients are
  rebuilt so the next call authenticates with it
- **Save to the key store** — written to `provider_keys.yaml` (git-ignored), encrypted
  when `OVARP_SECRET_KEY` is set and in plain text otherwise, and restored on boot
- **Show / Clear** — the raw key is never part of a status response; **Show** asks the
  server for it explicitly

### 📋 System Logs & Errors
Real-time streaming logs from all server components with color-coded severity,
filterable by level, searchable, and exportable as CSV.

---

## 🧍 Player (`/player`)

Two different things can talk to the agent, and the console header has a button for
each:

| | **OPEN PLAYER** (`/player`) | **WEB CLIENT** (`config.yaml → client_url`) |
|---|---|---|
| What it is | a plain page served by this server | the Unity WebGL build, published separately |
| Has | text chat, push-to-talk, event marker, latency readout | the embodied 3D agent, gestures, emotions |
| For | checking the pipeline works | what a participant actually uses |
| Reaches the server at | `ws://localhost:8000` | `wss://…` only — needs a tunnel |

`/player` is **not** a stand-in for the headset: it is a debugging surface. It connects
as an ordinary device over `/ws/client/{device_id}`, so a full loop — someone speaks,
the agent answers with voice, the researcher annotates from the console — can be
exercised with nothing but a browser.

Defaults to `web_panel_01` / `agent_alpha`; override with query parameters:

```
/player?device=web_panel_01&agent=agent_beta
```

Whatever you pass must exist in `config.yaml → devices` and `agents`, or the
server rejects the commands. Point the console's **Device** picker at the same id
to aim Speak This Text and gestures at it; **Copy pair info** yields the exact
socket URL.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

### `config.yaml` — Experiment Setup

The config file defines your experiment's structure. The LLM uses these as tool schemas, so it can trigger actions, emotions, and gaze targets autonomously.

```yaml
experiment:
  name: "My Study"

agents:
  - id: "agent_alpha"
    name: "Alpha"

custom_commands:
  emotions:
    description: "Agent emotional states"
    values: ["neutral", "happy", "sad", "angry", "surprised"]

  actions:
    description: "Physical actions the agent can perform"
    values: ["wave", "nod", "clap", "bow", "thumbs_up", "thinking", "shrug", "dance"]

  movement:
    description: "Agent spatial movement"
    values: ["move_closer", "move_farther", "move_left", "move_right", "reset_position"]

  avatar:
    description: "Change the agent's avatar appearance"
    values: ["default", "male_casual", "female_formal", "robot"]

# Experimental conditions (one-click presets)
conditions:
  empathetic:
    description: "Agent responds with high empathy and warm tone"
    system_prompt: "Be warm, empathetic, and supportive..."
    avatar: "female_formal"
    voice: "Kore"
  neutral:
    description: "Agent responds factually and neutrally"
    system_prompt: "Be neutral, factual, and concise..."
    avatar: "default"
    voice: "Puck"
```

> **💡 Tip:** Adding a new value to `custom_commands` automatically makes it available to the LLM as a tool call option — no code changes needed.

### `profiles/*.yaml` — Agent Profiles

Profiles define rich personas that can be applied to any agent at runtime. Each profile bundles identity, voice, personality, guardrails, and avatar into a single switchable unit.

```yaml
# profiles/therapist_male.yaml
id: therapist_male
name: "Dr. Marcus"

identity:
  age: 40
  gender: masculine
  role: "Virtual therapist"
  backstory: >
    A calm, experienced therapist who specializes in cognitive behavioral
    therapy. He listens carefully before responding.

voice:
  provider: gemini          # "openai", "gemini", or "auto"
  voice_id: Charon
  speed: 1.0

personality:
  system_prompt: >
    You are Dr. Marcus, a 40-year-old male therapist...
  self_disclosure: low      # low, medium, high
  formality: high
  empathy: high

guardrails:
  rules:
    - "Never give medical diagnoses"
    - "Do not discuss politics or religion"
  max_response_words: 150

avatar: male_casual
```

Drop new `.yaml` files into `profiles/` and they'll appear in the WoZ console Profiles tab automatically. The system prompt is auto-composed from all persona fields — researchers don't need to do manual prompt engineering.

> **💡 Migration:** Legacy `conditions:` entries in `config.yaml` are auto-migrated to profiles at startup. You can safely remove the `conditions:` section and use profiles instead.

### `scenarios/*.yaml` — Scripted Protocols

Scenario files define step-by-step experiment procedures that researchers can follow in the WoZ console. Each step can optionally auto-apply a condition, execute an action, or log an event marker.

```yaml
# scenarios/my_study.yaml
id: my_study
name: "My Custom Study"
description: "A 3-step study protocol."

steps:
  - id: intro
    instruction: "Welcome the participant and obtain consent."

  - id: main_task
    instruction: "Run the main task for 5 minutes."
    condition: empathetic           # auto-switch to this condition
    auto_marker: main_task_start    # auto-log this marker
    action:                         # auto-fire this command
      emotions: happy

  - id: debrief
    instruction: "Thank the participant. End the session."
    auto_marker: debrief_start
```

Drop new `.yaml` files into `scenarios/` and they'll appear in the WoZ console automatically on the next server restart.

### `.env` — API Keys

Keys can also be set from the console's **API Key Store** tab, which applies them to
the running providers at once and, on save, writes them to `provider_keys.yaml`
(git-ignored) — encrypted when `OVARP_SECRET_KEY` is set. A key saved there wins over
`.env` on the next boot: it is what the researcher set last.

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSy...
```

## 📡 Transport Protocols

### ZeroMQ (XR Clients)

Low-latency bidirectional communication for Unity/Unreal clients.

| Socket | Port | Direction | Purpose |
|--------|------|-----------|---------|
| PUB    | 5555 | Server → Client | Commands, TTS audio |
| SUB    | 5556 | Client → Server | Audio, text messages |

### WebSocket (Web Clients)

Full-duplex communication on `/ws` endpoint.

```javascript
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8000/ws');
ws.onmessage = (event) => {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    // data.type: "message" | "action" | "audio"
    // data.command: "llm_reply" | "execute_state" | "tts_chunk" | "tts_complete"
};
```

`venv/`, `logs/`, `data/sessions/`, `__pycache__/` and `.DS_Store` are generated
locally and are **not** versioned. They live in `.gitignore`; if you ever see one
staged, it was added before the rule existed — untrack it rather than committing
it. Session telemetry under `data/` is research output: back it up outside the
repository, because git is not keeping a copy.

## 🔌 Adding a New AI Provider

### From the UI (no code needed)

Most alternative LLM services (Ollama, LM Studio, vLLM, LocalAI, text-generation-webui) expose an **OpenAI-compatible API**. You can register these directly from the WoZ console:

1. Open the **LLM Playground** tab
2. Click **➕ Register Custom Endpoint** below the voice picker
3. Fill in:
   - **Name** — a short identifier (e.g. `my-ollama`)
   - **Base URL** — the endpoint URL (e.g. `http://localhost:11434/v1`)
   - **API Key** — optional for local services
   - **Model** — the model ID (e.g. `llama3.1`)
   - **Type** — check LLM, TTS, or both
4. Click **🔗 Test** to verify connectivity, then **📝 Register**

The provider immediately appears in the LLM dropdown and is persisted to `custom_providers.yaml` across restarts.

You can also register providers via the REST API:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/providers/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "my-ollama", "base_url": "http://localhost:11434/v1", "model": "llama3.1", "types": ["llm"]}'
```

> **💡 Function calling fallback:** If the custom endpoint doesn't support OpenAI-style function/tool calling, the provider falls back to plain text responses. Chat works normally, but the LLM won't auto-trigger avatar emotions or gestures. You can extend `custom_provider.py` to add custom action extraction logic if needed.

### From code (for non-OpenAI-compatible APIs)

For services that don't follow the OpenAI API format, implement the abstract base classes:

```python
from src.providers.base import BaseLLMProvider, BaseTTSProvider

class MyLLMProvider(BaseLLMProvider):
    async def generate_response(self, prompt, system_prompt=None):
        yield "Hello from my custom LLM!"

    async def generate_response_with_actions(self, prompt, system_prompt=None, history=None):
        return "Hello!", {"emotions": "happy", "actions": "wave"}

class MyTTSProvider(BaseTTSProvider):
    async def synthesize_stream(self, text):
        audio_bytes = my_tts_api(text)
        yield audio_bytes
```

Then register in `main.py`:
```python
llm_providers = {
    "openai": OpenAILLMProvider(),
    "gemini": GeminiLLMProvider(),
    "custom": MyLLMProvider(),       # ← Add here
}
```

## 🧪 Running Tests

Install `requirements_dev.txt` first, then:

```bash
OVARP_TESTING=1 OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-dummy GEMINI_API_KEY=dummy pytest -q
# 280 tests across profiles, schemas, sessions, scenarios, surveys, XR telemetry,
# orchestrator, router, providers, the key store, security, and HTTP endpoints
```

`OVARP_TESTING=1` skips the transport and provider bootstrap and serves a bare
app, so no network call or real API key is involved. The dummy keys only satisfy
the provider constructors.

Lint with `ruff check src/ tests/`.

## ⏱️ Latency Measurement

Every turn records four timings: `stt_ms`, `llm_ms`, `tts_ms` and `total_ms`.

They cannot all be published at once. `llm_reply` is broadcast as soon as the
model answers, so it carries only `stt_ms` and `llm_ms` — `tts_ms` does not
exist until the audio stage finishes. The complete figures are therefore
published afterwards as a separate `system` / `latency` command, which the
console uses to finish the timing line on the reply it already drew.

The same complete record is written to the session JSONL as an `event: latency`
entry and flattened into the four rightmost columns of the CSV export, so the
`latency_validation` protocol is analysable in SPSS/R without post-processing.

SDK clients receive it through the `onLatency` callback.
