"""
Open Virtual Agent Research Platform (OVARP) — Transport Base Class

Defines ``BaseTransport``, the abstract base class for all communication
layers. Transports handle bidirectional message flow between the server
and connected clients (XR headsets, web browsers, mobile apps).
Supports callback registration for inbound message dispatching.
